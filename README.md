# SQL Server 2017 Machine Learning Services with R
This is the code repository for [SQL Server 2017 Machine Learning Services with R](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/sql-server-2017-machine-learning-services-r?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787283572), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
R Services was one of the most anticipated features in SQL Server 2016, improved significantly and rebranded as SQL Server 2017 Machine 
Learning Services. Prior to SQL Server 2016, many developers and data scientists were already using R to connect to SQL Server in siloed 
environments that left a lot to be desired, in order to do additional data analysis, superseding SSAS Data Mining or additional CLR 
programming functions. With R integrated within SQL Server 2017, these developers and data scientists can now benefit from its integrated, effective, efficient, and more streamlined analytics environment.

This book gives you foundational knowledge and insights to help you understand SQL Server 2017 Machine Learning Services with R. First and foremost, the book provides practical examples on how to implement, use, and understand SQL Server and R integration in corporate 
environments, and also provides explanations and underlying motivations. It covers installing Machine Learning Services;maintaining, 
deploying, and managing code; and monitoring your services.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

Chapter 1 does not contain any code files.

The code will look like the following:
```
> df <- data.frame(unlist(var_info))
> df
```

In order to work with SQL Server Machine Learning Services, and to run the code examples
found in this book, the following software will be required:
* SQL Server 2016 and/or SQL Server 2017 Developer or Enterprise Edition
* SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
* R IDE such as R Studio or Visual Studio 2017 with RTVS extension
* Visual Studio 2017 Community edition with the following extensions installed:
  * R Tools for Visual Studio (RTVS)
  * SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)
* VisualStudio.com online account

The chapters in this book go through the installation and configuration steps as the software is introduced.
